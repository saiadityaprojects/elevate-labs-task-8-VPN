screenshots/: A collection of screenshots providing visual evidence of the VPN's functionality, including the IP address before and after connecting.

📝 Key Learnings
Through this task, I gained a practical understanding of:


VPN Functionality: How a VPN creates a secure, encrypted tunnel to mask a user's IP address and location.




Online Privacy: The role of a VPN in preventing third parties from tracking online activity and real-world location.


Encryption: The importance of encryption in a VPN tunnel, which scrambles data to make it unreadable to anyone who intercepts it.


Performance Impact: The effects of using a VPN on network speed, which can be slightly reduced due to the encryption process.
